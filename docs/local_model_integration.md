# Local Model Integration Summary

## Implementation Details

We've successfully integrated local model inference capabilities into DeFacture using the Phi-2 model that was already available in the local Hugging Face cache. This implementation:

1. **Leverages the locally cached Phi-2 model** for context analysis without making API calls
2. **Falls back gracefully** to API or mock data if the local model is unavailable
3. **Provides a clear UI** indicating which model is being used (Local, API, or Mock)
4. **Includes a diagnostic tool** (`check_local_models.py`) to verify local model availability
5. **Updates documentation** to explain the benefits and setup process for local models

## Features Added

- **New model option in UI**: "Phi-2 (Local)" added to the context analysis model selection
- **Visual indicators**: Icons and color coding to show model source (üíª Local, üåê API, üîÑ Mock)
- **Model availability detection**: The UI shows whether local models are available
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Graceful fallbacks if dependencies are missing
- **Documentation**: Updated README with local model information

## Benefits

- **Reduced API calls**: Using local models saves API quota and reduces costs
- **Faster analysis**: Local inference eliminates network latency
- **Privacy**: All processing happens locally with no data sent to external services
- **Flexibility**: Users can choose between local, API, or mock options based on their needs

## Technical Details

- The implementation uses PyTorch and the Transformers library
- The Phi-2 model is loaded with appropriate settings for the available hardware
- CPU fallback is implemented with proper dtype handling
- Output is structured for consistent context analysis results

This implementation ensures that DeFacture can provide high-quality context analysis even without an internet connection or API access, while maintaining the option to use remote APIs when needed.
