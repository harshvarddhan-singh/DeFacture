🔧 FILE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. ✅ Updated main.py to use refactored version
2. ✅ Updated __init__.py with new module list
3. ✅ Moved old file to article_input_OLD_BACKUP.py
4. ✅ Renamed refactored version to article_input.py
5. ✅ Tested all imports and functionality
6. ✅ Verified Streamlit app compatibility
